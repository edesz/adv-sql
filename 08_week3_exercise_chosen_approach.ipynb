While it is still fairly small, we need to develop a query to measure the impact of the changes to our search algorithm. Please create a query and review the query profile to ensure that the query will be efficient once the activity increases.\n",

    "### Overview of Best Practices Used\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are some Snowflake best practices that were used to optimize query performance here\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Query Optimization](https://www.chaosgenius.io/blog/snowflake-query-tuning-part1/)\n",
    "1. Choose a larger warehouse size and compare the performance gain of a larger warehouse to the extra cost\n",
    "   - admin permissions required\n",
    "   - not controllable here\n",
    "   - <span style=\"color:red\">this was not used here</span>\n",
    "2. Use result caching\n",
    "   - by default, the result cache expires after 24 hours\n",
    "     - this could be leveraged during production by pre-running the report query; subsequent runs of the report within the next 24 hours can leverage the cached result to get fast execution times\n",
    "     - we don't know if the report must be run by multiple stakeholders in production or if result caching can be leveraged in production\n",
    "   - not known if this is useful here\n",
    "   - <span style=\"color:red\">this was not used here</span>\n",
    "3. Use materialized views\n",
    "   - these are beneficial when the view's data does not change frequently but is used often\n",
    "     - the report is generated daily\n",
    "     - we don't know if the report must be run by multiple stakeholders in production and how often they will do so\n",
    "   - not known if this is useful here\n",
    "   - <span style=\"color:red\">this was not used here</span>\n",
    "4. Use data clustering and micro partitioning to speed up queries\n",
    "   - the `events.warehouse_activity` table does not support clustering\n",
    "   - not relevant here\n",
    "   - <span style=\"color:red\">this was not used here</span>\n",
    "5. Use Snowflake query acceleration\n",
    "   - admin permissions required\n",
    "   - not controllable here\n",
    "   - <span style=\"color:red\">this was not used here</span>\n",
    "6. Use Snowflake query profiler\n",
    "   - <span style=\"color:green\">this was used here</span>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### [Query Tuning](https://www.chaosgenius.io/blog/snowflake-query-tuning-2/)\n",
    "1. Select only required columns (also called [projection pushdown](https://trino.io/docs/current/optimizer/pushdown.html#projection-pushdown))\n",
    "   - <span style=\"color:green\">this was used here</span>\n",
    "2. Optimize sorting (reduce calls to `ORDER BY`)\n",
    "   - here, the order of query results is not speicfied\n",
    "     - we will **assume** that the report will want the above four metrics in chronological order for readability, so *<u>only</u>* the final query will be sorted by session date\n",
    "   - <span style=\"color:green\">this was used here</span>\n",
    "3. Using `JOIN`s instead of sub-queries\n",
    "   - this will not be used here\n",
    "   - [some SQL style guides prefer to avoid this approach](https://github.com/brooklyn-data/co/blob/main/sql_style_guide.md#when-inner-joining-put-filter-conditions-in-the-where-clause-instead-of-the-join-clause) and recommend placing filter conditions in the `WHERE` clause (similar to [predicate pushdown](https://trino.io/docs/current/optimizer/pushdown.html#projection-pushdown))\n",
    "     - predicate pushdown will be used here\n",
    "   - <span style=\"color:green\">this was used here</span>"

Such sessions should only have been counted on the first day of the session and not on the second day. Also, session length was recorded on the first date since `session_date` was recorded on the date on which the session started, so the session length should been excluded from the second date. In summary, such multi-day sessions should not have been (i) counted on both days and (ii) used to calculate session length on the second day. However, such logic has not been implemented earlier in the query. So, these rows must now be filtered out using `WHERE session_length > 0`.\n",

For these rows, concatenate the `recipe_id`s into a comma-separated string on a single row using `GROUP BY`+`LISTAGG`. Based on [SQL order of operations](https://www.sisense.com/blog/sql-query-order-of-operations/), the `JOIN` is executed before the `GROUP BY`. For this reason, a `LEFT JOIN` is needed so that no rows are lost if multiple recipes were tied for the most daily views.\n",

    "**Observations**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `WithReference` operator appears twice in the query execution plan. This is expected since the first CTE is referenced by the (a) `most_viewed_recipe_daily` and (b) `session_summary` CTEs.\n",
    "2. The `Sort` operator is expensive and only appears once. This is expected since `ORDER BY` was only applied on the final result which was aggregated daily.\n",
    "3. `JoinFilter` is used to identify rows that do not match the `JOIN` condition. Here, a `LEFT JOIN` is used where there are more rows on the LHS, so there are no mismatched rows to filter out. In the query execution plan, this is labeled as <span style=\"color:orange\">`LEFT JOIN` is used so this has no impact</span>.\n",
    "4. A `Filter` is applied after a `TableScan` once. In this scenario, the `TableScan` is performing the filtering so the `Filter` step has no impact. Also, a `WHERE` clause is not used in the main CTE. For this reason, the input and output row counts of the filter are the same after the `Filter` operator. In the query execution plan diagram, `Filter` is labeled as <span style=\"color:#d4628d\">does not do anything</span>.\n",
    "5. From a high-level view of the query execution plan on slide 2\n",
    "   - the two types of metrics to be calculated (three session-based metrics and one metric for recipe views) are separated and are shown in <span style=\"color:blue\">blue</span> and <span style=\"color:#df03db\">dark pink</span>. This is expected since this separation was necessary since a window function function was used to find the most viewed daily recipe\n",
    "     - `session_summary` and `daily_session_summary` calculate the three daily session-based metrics. These CTEs are shown in the <span style=\"color:blue\">blue box</span>. They do not need to rank recipes based on views, so they do not need to apply the `RANK()` window function.\n",
    "     - `most_viewed_recipe_daily` is the only CTE that is concerned about ranking recipes based on daily views. These CTEs are shown in the <span style=\"color:#df03db\">dark pink box</span>.\n",
    "6. From the zoomed verson of the execution plan on slide 3, the two separate daily aggregations are `LEFT JOIN`ed. The number of rows after the `JOIN` is larger than before the `JOIN` since multiple recipes are tied for most views on some days. This is labeled on slide 3 as *<span style=\"color:#78339a\">More rows after LEFT JOIN due to ties in RANK()</span>*. It is reassuring that after concatenating ties into the same row using `LISTAGG`, the number of rows matches those in the CTE on the LHS of the `LEFT JOIN` and there is one row per date.\n",
    "7. The query profile verifies findings from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and are labeled on slide 3 as *<span style=\"color:#7a3d18\">verifies finding from EDA</span>*\n",
    "   - in `most_viewed_recipe_daily`, 55 rows are produced which matches 55 recipe views found during [EDA](https://nbviewer.org/github/edesz/adv-sql/blob/main/07_week3_exercise_eda.ipynb)\n",
    "   - in `session_summary`, 178 rows are produced which the total unique sessions found during [EDA](https://nbviewer.org/github/edesz/adv-sql/blob/main/07_week3_exercise_eda.ipynb)\n",
    "8. In the first CTE, the `WindowFunction` node (shown in the <span style=\"color:green\">green box</span> on slide 3) is the most expensive node of the entire query. This is expected for two reasons\n",
    "   - since two window functions were used and they were both applied to all events in the table. It was necessary to read all events from the table in order to calculate session length for the second report metric (average session length)\n",
    "   - the window function contains a nested `PARSE_JSON`, which is also applied to each row since we need to extract the attributes of the `event_details` column for all events in the table so they could be accessed in CTEs\n",
    "9. There are a lot of processing operations being performed such as aggregations, window functions and `JOIN`s. So, from the **Profile Overview**, it is not surprising that processing time dominates the overall time required to execute the query."

    "1. The `WithReference` operator appears twice in the query execution plan. This is expected since the first CTE is referenced by the (a) `most_viewed_recipe_daily` and (b) `session_summary` CTEs.\n",
    "2. The `Sort` operator is expensive and only appears once. This is expected since `ORDER BY` was only applied on the final result which was aggregated daily.\n",
    "3. A `Filter` is applied after a `TableScan` once. In this scenario, the `TableScan` is performing the filtering so the `Filter` step has no impact. Also, a `WHERE` clause is not used in the main CTE. For this reason, the input and output row counts of the filter are the same after the `Filter` operator. In the query execution plan diagram, `Filter` is labeled as <span style=\"color:#d4628d\">does not do anything</span>.\n",
    "4. From a high-level view of the query execution plan on slide 2\n",
    "   - the two types of metrics to be calculated (three session-based metrics and one metric for recipe views) are separated and are shown in <span style=\"color:blue\">blue</span> and <span style=\"color:#df03db\">dark pink</span>. This is expected since this separation was necessary since a window function function was used to find the most viewed daily recipe\n",
    "     - `session_summary` and `daily_session_summary` calculate the three daily session-based metrics. These CTEs are shown in the <span style=\"color:blue\">blue box</span>. They do not need to rank recipes based on views, so they do not need to apply the `RANK()` window function.\n",
    "     - `most_viewed_recipe_daily` is the only CTE that is concerned about ranking recipes based on daily views. These CTEs are shown in the <span style=\"color:#df03db\">dark pink box</span>.\n",
    "5. From the zoomed verson of the execution plan on slide 3, the two separate daily aggregations are `LEFT JOIN`ed. The number of rows after the `JOIN` is larger than before the `JOIN` since multiple recipes are tied for most views on some days. This is labeled on slide 3 as *<span style=\"color:#78339a\">More rows after LEFT JOIN due to ties in RANK()</span>*. It is reassuring that after concatenating ties into the same row using `LISTAGG`, the number of rows matches those in the CTE on the LHS of the `LEFT JOIN` and there is one row per date.\n",
    "6. The query profile verifies findings from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and are labeled on slide 3 as *<span style=\"color:#7a3d18\">verifies finding from EDA</span>*\n",
    "   - in `most_viewed_recipe_daily`, 55 rows are produced which matches 55 recipe views found during [EDA](https://nbviewer.org/github/edesz/adv-sql/blob/main/07_week3_exercise_eda.ipynb)\n",
    "   - in `session_summary`, 178 rows are produced which the total unique sessions found during [EDA](https://nbviewer.org/github/edesz/adv-sql/blob/main/07_week3_exercise_eda.ipynb)\n",
    "7. In the first CTE, the `WindowFunction` node (shown in the <span style=\"color:green\">green box</span> on slide 3) is the most expensive node of the entire query. This is expected for two reasons\n",
    "   - since two window functions were used and they were both applied to all events in the table. It was necessary to read all events from the table in order to calculate session length for the second report metric (average session length)\n",
    "   - the window function contains a nested `PARSE_JSON`, which is also applied to each row since we need to extract the attributes of the `event_details` column for all events in the table so they could be accessed in CTEs\n",
    "8. There are a lot of processing operations being performed such as aggregations, window functions and `JOIN`s. So, from the **Profile Overview**, it is not surprising that processing time dominates the overall time required to execute the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "**From the output of the `get_query_operator_stats()` function**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The query does not suffer from two of the four common query problems (exploding `JOIN`s and intermediate results are too large to fit in memory) and this should help when the query has to scale from capturing metrics for 200 users in the report to capturing 5,000 users.\n",
    "2. The other two common query problems were not relevant here\n",
    "   - use of `UNION` when `UNION ALL` was sufficient\n",
    "     - this was not applicable here since `UNION` was not used in the query\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Dropping duplicated events (duplicated `event_timestamp`s) within each session is expensive and it will become a bigger problem when website traffic increases. Dropping duplicates <u>is not necessary</u> to correctly calculate the four metrics required in the report.**\n",
    "   - (question 1) count the number of unique sessions\n",
    "     - only the `session_id` column is needed to count the number of unique sessions. The `session_id` is the same for all events in the session, regardless of whether some `event_timestamp`s are duplicated or not. So, duplicates were not dropped when counting the number of unique sessions.\n",
    "   - (question 2) get the average session length on a daily basis\n",
    "     - The `MIN()` and `MAX()` functions pick up the `event_timestamp`s of the first and last events respectively. The difference between these two timestamps is sufficient to calculate session length. The duplicates occur at the start of the session, which effects the use of the `MIN()` function. However, since `event_timestamp` is the same for the duplicated events, the `MIN()` function correctly picks up the first event of the session even if duplicated events are present in the table. So, duplicates were not dropped when calculating the average session length each day.\n",
    "   - (question 3) count the number of searches performed before viewing a recipe\n",
    "     - only events corresponding to views of the home page (which occurred at the start of each session) were found to be duplicated and not events that were logged later in a session when a user (a) performed a search or (b) viewed a recipe. Checking if a recipe was viewed and counting the number of searches performed before viewing the recipe do not need to take home page views into account. Filtering the `JSON` of the `event_details` column is sufficient to get (a) and (b), regardless of whether the events in each session before the user search are duplicated. So, duplicates were not dropped for calculating the average number of searches performed in each user session in which a recipe was viewed.\n",
    "   - (question 4) get the ID of the most viewed recipe\n",
    "     - user views of the recipe only occurs at the end of a session. So first event of the session is not needed to extract this ID. Duplicates only occurr for the first event of the session. So, duplicates were not dropped for getting the ID of the most viewed recipe.\n",
    "2. **(Column Pruning or Projection Pushdown) Redundant columns are present in the `website_activity` table and are excluded in all CTEs. Including such columns in CTEs will become more expensive as website traffic increases.** This is especially important in the first CTE (in step 1. of the query) which returns output at the events level. Redundancy is handled as follows\n",
    "   - the `event_timestamp` is used to calculate the average session length in seconds on a daily basis. If the `event_timestamp` column is used from the `website_activity` table then the `event_id` column is redundant. Also, the report does not require metrics at the event level. So, `event_id` is excluded from the first (`session_last_event_all_events_json`) CTE.\n",
    "   - the `session_id` column is used to count the number of daily unique sessions. Each user session is assigned a unique `session_id`. Also, the report does not require a count of the number of users. So, if the `session_id` column is used then the `user_id` column is redundant and so it is also excluded from the first (`session_last_event_all_events_json`) CTE.\n",
    "3. Event processing is only performed in the first CTE (`session_last_event_all_events_json`). **[Parsing `JSON` can be expensive](https://www.castordoc.com/how-to/how-to-use-parse-json-in-snowflake) and will become slower as website traffic increases, so it is only performed in this first CTE** in order to convert the `event_details` column into a `VARIANT` type. Parsing `JSON` is needed at the events level, since we need to extract information later about the type of events and order of events in each session. By calling `PARSE_JSON` in the first CTE, the `event` and `recipe_id` attributes can be accessed from the `VARIANT` column in later CTEs. No additional datatype conversion operations are performed in the overall query. All other CTEs (except the first CTE) return aggregated outputs at the session of day level. `PARSE_JSON` is called twice since it is needed for the following\n",
    "   - `PARSE_JSON` is called in the `session_last_event_all_events_json` CTE to convert the `event_details` column from a `VARCHAR` into `VARIANT` datatype for every event in this column\n",
    "   - `PARSE_JSON` is called inside a window function in the same CTE to convert the last event in the `event_details` column into a `VARIANT` datatype which can be later queried to access the `recipe_id`\n",
    "4. String functions are expensive and will be a bigger performance hit as the number of users on Virtual Kitchen increases. One string operation is needed: to clean the `recipe_id` by removing the leading and trailing `\"`. Multiple recipes might be viewed every day. To minimize the use of string functions, the most-viewed recipe(s) are first identified and then the `recipe_id` is cleaned. So, the query takes advantage of [SQL order of operations](https://builtin.com/data-science/sql-order-of-execution) to only apply string operations *after* daily aggregation (using `GROUP BY`) is performed. By doing this, **the use of string cleaning operations is minimized since only one or two `recipe_id` strings are cleaned per day.**\n",
    "5. **Only the best `recipe_id`s per day are returned by the `most_viewed_recipe_daily` CTE using `QUALIFY`**. As mentioned above, multiple recipes might be viewed every day. As the platform is opened to more users, the number of recipes viewed daily might grow further. So, the number of rows returned by the `most_viewed_recipe_daily` will also grow. The report only needs the ID(s) of the most-viewed recipe per day. This was retrieved using a window function (`RANK()`). If only this ID (`RANK() OVER(...) = 1`) is returned daily, then the number of rows returned by the `most_viewed_recipe_daily` CTE is reduced. This approach has two performance benefits when extracting the most viewed recipe(s) daily\n",
    "   - avoids duplication of the window logic to get the most viewed recipe(s) daily between this CTE and the final CTE (`daily_report_summary_sessions_recipe`)\n",
    "   - filters out recipes as early as possible in the overall query, which improves performance when the number of users grows"
